# react-apps

- mini projects/apps i coded during my react learning journey, contributing to my learning process and enabling me to explore react.
- i started my journey with 'create-react-app' and continued with 'vite'.
- i style them with tailwind CSS.

## projects:

#### 1.  employee app
- my first react project 
- it isn't something fancy; helped me learn about states.
#### 2.  cheery store
- frontend store project.
- users can add these products to their cart and delete the items individually or all at once.
- when a product already in the cart is re-added, it doesn't create a new item; instead, the quantity of the existing item increases, and the price is updated.
#### 3.  feedback app
- frontend feedback app project.
- feedback entries are currently hardcoded, allowing users to add, delete, and modify entries.
- _in the next phase, the backend will be developed, enabling feedback retrieval from a custom server._

##### - new projects on the way!
